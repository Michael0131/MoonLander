Apollo 11 Lander Simulator

A lightweight, user‑friendly simulation of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module (LM) descent. This project models realistic lunar physics, LM rotation, thrust, and velocity—allowing you to pilot the lander in real time.

🚀 Overview

This program simulates the LM's motion at 1‑second intervals, updating:

Position (x, y)

Velocity (dx, dy)

Speed

Orientation (angle)

Your mission: land softly. Touchdown must occur at a vertical speed slower than 4.0 m/s, or the lander will crash.

🎮 Controls

The lander is controlled using the arrow keys:

⬇️ Down Arrow — Fire main engine (primary thrust)

⬅️ Left Arrow — Rotate counter‑clockwise

➡️ Right Arrow — Rotate clockwise

A safe landing requires slow and careful adjustments.
